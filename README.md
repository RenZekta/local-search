# 🔍 Local Search — a private web-browsing system for AI models

**SearXNG + Firecrawl + the local-web agent skill, running entirely on your machine, behind two local ports.**

Give any LLM — a local model in LM Studio, a cloud model, an agent, an MCP
client, or a plain chat UI — the ability to **search the web and read pages**
without sending a single request to a paid scraping API. Everything runs in
Docker on your computer; your queries, results, and page contents never leave
your network.

| What | URL (default) | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **SearXNG**  | `http://localhost:9990` | Metasearch + JSON API. Aggregates Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo/etc. |
| **Firecrawl** | `http://localhost:9991` | Scrape / crawl / map / search / extract — returns clean Markdown. |
| **local-web** | `~/.agents/skills/local-web` | Bundled agent skill: search + read + auto-start the stack. |

> Both ports are fully configurable at install time. The defaults (`9990` and
> `9991`) are chosen to avoid clashing with common dev servers.

## What you get

A single Docker Compose stack of six services on a private bridge network,
**plus** a ready-made agent skill that ties it all together:

| Service | Image | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| **searxng** | `searxng/searxng:latest` | Metasearch engine with **JSON output enabled** and the rate-limiter **disabled**, so models can query it programmatically. |
| **firecrawl** | `ghcr.io/firecrawl/firecrawl:latest` | The scraping/crawling/search API. Runs with `USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false` → **no API key needed** for local use. |
| **playwright-service** | `ghcr.io/firecrawl/playwright-service:latest` | Headless Chromium for JavaScript-rendered pages. |
| **redis** | `redis:alpine` | Firecrawl job queue. |
| **rabbitmq** | `rabbitmq:3-management` | Firecrawl message broker. |
| **nuq-postgres** | `ghcr.io/firecrawl/nuq-postgres:latest` | Firecrawl job-state DB (pg_cron enabled). |

On top of the containers, the installer bundles **local-web** — a skill for
agents that load skills from `~/.agents/skills/` (`C:\Users\You\.agents\skills\`
on Windows). It gives the agent a complete web-research workflow: search via
SearXNG, read pages via Firecrawl, and even start the Docker stack
automatically when it's down. See [section A](#a-the-bundled-local-web-skill-recommended).

Only **two host ports** are published (`9990` and `9991` by default). Everything
else stays on the private `local-search-net` bridge network. Firecrawl's
`/v1/search` endpoint is automatically wired to SearXNG internally, so a single
Firecrawl call can both search *and* fetch full page content.

---

## Requirements

- **Docker** with the **Compose v2 plugin** (`docker compose`).
  - Windows / macOS: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - Linux: [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + the `docker-compose-plugin` package. Add your user to the `docker` group so you don't need `sudo`.
- **~5 GB free disk** for images and data.
- **8 GB RAM / 4 CPU cores** recommended (the Firecrawl + Playwright stack is the heavy part; reduce resource limits in `docker-compose.yml` for smaller hosts).
- **Python 3.8+** for the bundled local-web skill scripts (optional but recommended — it's the easiest way to use the stack).
- *(Optional, for Firecrawl AI features)* **LM Studio** or any OpenAI-compatible local server — see [section D](#d-connect-a-local-llm-lm-studio-etc).
- *(Optional, for MCP)* **Node.js 18+** so `npx firecrawl-mcp` works.

Verify Docker is ready:

```bash
docker info            # engine is running
docker compose version # v2 is installed
```

---

## Quick start (one-click install)

> **The installer is self-contained.** Every file it needs (`docker-compose.yml`,
> `config/searxng/settings.yml`, `.env.example`, the bundled `local-web` skill,
> all the run/stop/update/uninstall scripts, this README, and even the *other*
> platform's installer) is embedded inside it. You can download **just
> `install-local-search.bat`** (Windows) or **just `install-local-search.sh`**
> (Linux/macOS) on its own and the installer will still produce a complete,
> working folder. Downloading the whole `local-search` folder or the zip just
> makes the install a little faster (it copies files instead of decoding them).

Run **one** installer for your platform. It will ask you a few things — install
folder, SearXNG port, Firecrawl port, (optionally) a local LLM — with sensible
defaults you can accept by pressing **Enter**. It then generates
cryptographically-secure credentials, writes your `.env`, **installs the
local-web skill**, pulls the images, and starts the stack.

> **Docker isn't running?** No problem — the installer starts it for you: it
> launches Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or the Docker service
> (`systemctl`/`service`, Linux) and waits up to 5 minutes for the engine while
> you answer the prompts. (Override the wait with the
> `LOCAL_SEARCH_DOCKER_TIMEOUT` env var, in seconds.)

### Windows

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) — no need to open it first; the installer launches it automatically.
2. Double-click **`install-local-search.bat`** (or run it from a terminal).

```
--- Step 1 of 4: Install location ----------
  Target folder [press Enter for default]:            # C:\Users\You\local-search
--- Step 2 of 4: SearXNG port (default 9990) ------
  Port for SearXNG [press Enter for 9990]: 9990
--- Step 3 of 4: Firecrawl port (default 9991) ----
  Port for Firecrawl [press Enter for 9991]: 9991
--- Step 4 of 4: Local LLM (optional) -------------
  Connect a local LLM now? [y/N]:                       # optional, see section D
```

### Linux & macOS

```bash
chmod +x install-local-search.sh
./install-local-search.sh
```

The prompts are the same. Defaults: install to `~/local-search`, SearXNG on
`9990`, Firecrawl on `9991`. A stopped Docker engine is started automatically
(Docker Desktop on macOS, `systemctl`/`service` on Linux).

> **First run downloads ~3–4 GB of Docker images** (the Playwright image bundles
> a full Chromium). Subsequent starts are a few seconds.

When it finishes you'll see:

```
SearXNG  (search + JSON API):  http://localhost:9990
Firecrawl (scrape/crawl API): http://localhost:9991
Agent skill: C:\Users\You\.agents\skills\local-web   (or ~/.agents/skills/local-web)
```

Open `http://localhost:9990` in a browser to see the SearXNG search UI — or,
if your agent loads skills from `~/.agents/skills/`, just ask it to research
something current and it will use **local-web** automatically (see
[section A](#a-the-bundled-local-web-skill-recommended)).

---

## Managing the stack

After install, the management scripts live **in your install folder**
(`C:\Users\You\local-search` on Windows, `~/local-search` on Linux/macOS).
They auto-detect their own location, so you can run them from anywhere by
double-clicking or `./`-ing them.

| Action | Windows | Linux / macOS |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Start** the stack | `Run.bat` | `./run.sh` |
| **Stop** (keep data) | `Stop.bat` | `./stop.sh` |
| **Update** images + apply `.env` changes + **re-sync the skill** | `Update.bat` | `./update.sh` |
| **Uninstall** (containers + volumes + skill, optional folder delete) | `Uninstall.bat` | `./uninstall.sh` |

- **Stop** only removes containers; your data volumes (Firecrawl job state,
  redis cache, rabbitmq/postgres data) are preserved.
- **Update** runs `docker compose pull` then `docker compose up -d`, so it
  both upgrades images **and** applies any port/LLM edits you made to `.env`;
  it also re-copies the bundled `local-web` skill into `~/.agents/skills/`.
- **Uninstall** runs `docker compose down -v` (deletes volumes + data),
  removes the `local-web` skill from `~/.agents/skills/local-web`, then
  optionally deletes the install folder. Pulled images are kept; reclaim them
  with `docker image prune -a` if desired.

   └─────── private docker network ──────┘
                 local-search-net
   also on it: playwright-service (Chromium), redis, rabbitmq, nuq-postgres
```

Three key wiring decisions the installer makes for you:

1. **SearXNG JSON + no limiter** — `config/searxng/settings.yml` sets
   `search.formats: [html, json]` and `server.limiter: false`, so models can hit
   `/search?format=json` without being blocked as a bot.
2. **Firecrawl → SearXNG** — the Firecrawl container sets
   `SEARXNG_ENDPOINT=http://searxng:8080`, so Firecrawl's `/v1/search` uses your
   local SearXNG instead of needing a third-party search provider.
3. **local-web skill auto-install** — the installer copies the bundled skill to
   `~/.agents/skills/local-web/` (add/override) and records the install path in
   an `install-dir.txt` hint inside the skill, so the skill finds the stack even
   if you installed to a custom folder and Docker isn't running yet.

---

## Using it with AI models

There are **seven** ways to use this system, from lowest to highest
integration. Pick what fits your stack — you can mix and match.

### A. The bundled local-web skill (recommended)

The installer ships with **local-web**, an agent skill that turns any
skill-loading agent into a web researcher with zero configuration. If your
agent reads skills from `~/.agents/skills/`
(`C:\Users\You\.agents\skills\` on Windows), it's already available after
install — restart the agent if it was running.

The installer:
- puts a copy in `<install folder>/local-web/`, and
- **automatically installs (add/override)** it into
  `~/.agents/skills/local-web/`.

What the skill does for the agent:

- **Finds the stack automatically.** It reads the real ports from your `.env`
  (so custom install-time ports just work) and locates the install folder via
  the compose labels on the running containers, the installer-recorded
  `install-dir.txt` hint, or `~/local-search` — no hardcoded anything.
- **Self-heals a down stack — no warm-up step.** If the Docker engine or the
  containers are down when a search/scrape runs, the script boots the engine
  (Docker Desktop / `systemctl start docker`), runs the same `docker compose
  up -d` that `Run.bat` / `run.sh` use, waits for the endpoints, and retries
  the request — so the agent calls the search/scrape scripts directly, even
  in an old conversation where the stack has since gone down
  (`ensure_stack.py` remains available as an optional pre-flight check). The
  stack is **never stopped** by the scripts (stopping is your job, via
  `Stop.bat` / `stop.sh`).
- **Searches the web.** `web_search.py "query"` prints the top results as
  `title / url / snippet`, with `--limit`, `--time-range day|week|month`, and
  `--categories it,news,general` options.
- **Reads pages.** `web_scrape.py <url>` returns the page as clean Markdown
  (truncated at 20,000 chars; raise with `--max-chars`).

Manual usage (exactly what the agent runs — no separate start step needed):

```bash
python ~/.agents/skills/local-web/scripts/web_search.py "latest python release"
python ~/.agents/skills/local-web/scripts/web_scrape.py "https://example.com"
# optional pre-flight check / status report:
python ~/.agents/skills/local-web/scripts/ensure_stack.py --check
```

The full agent-facing instructions live in the skill's `SKILL.md`. Keeping the
skill fresh is automatic: `Update.bat` / `./update.sh` re-syncs it, and
re-running the installer overwrites it. Uninstalling removes it.

> The skill only needs **Python 3.8+** on the host — no pip packages, no API
> keys, no MCP support required from the agent.

---

### B. Direct SearXNG JSON API

The simplest possible integration: hit SearXNG's JSON endpoint and feed the
results into any model's context. No SDK, no key, no MCP.

```bash
# Search the web, return JSON, show the top 5 results
curl -s "http://localhost:9990/search?q=latest+AI+news&format=json" \
  | jq '.results[:5] | .[] | {title, url, content}'
```

Useful query params: `&pageno=2`, `&categories=it,images`, `&time_range=day`,
`&language=en`, `&engines=google,bing,duckduckgo`.

In Python:

```python
import requests
r = requests.get("http://localhost:9990/search", params={
    "q": "rust async runtime tokio",
    "format": "json",
    "language": "en",
}).json()
for hit in r["results"][:5]:
    print(hit["title"], "->", hit["url"])
    print(hit.get("content", "")[:200])
```

> SearXNG returns titles, URLs, and short content snippets — perfect for a
> "search then summarize" agent loop. For **full page text**, use Firecrawl (C).

---

### C. Direct Firecrawl REST API

Firecrawl turns any URL into clean Markdown/HTML/JSON — ideal for RAG. Because
the self-hosted instance runs with `USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false`, **no API key
is required** (you can send any `Authorization: Bearer …` header, or none).

#### Scrape a single page → Markdown

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9991/v1/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","formats":["markdown"]}' \
  | jq '.data.markdown'
```

#### Search the web (uses your SearXNG internally) + return full content

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9991/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"what is rust programming language","limit":5}' \
  | jq '.data[:3] | .[] | {title, url, markdown}'
```

#### Crawl a whole site (async)

```bash
# 1) start the crawl
JOB=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9991/v1/crawl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://docs.example.com","limit":20}' | jq -r .id)

# 2) poll until status == "completed"
curl -s "http://localhost:9991/v1/crawl/$JOB" | jq '{status, completed, total}'
```

#### Map a site's URL tree (fast, no scraping)

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9991/v1/map \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","limit":50}' | jq '.links'
```

#### Extract structured data with an LLM (needs section D configured)

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9991/v1/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls":["https://example.com"],"prompt":"Extract the company name and a contact email"}' \
  | jq '.data'
```

#### Using the Firecrawl SDKs (Node / Python)

Self-host works with the official SDKs — point them at your local URL and pass
any non-empty string as the key:

**Node.js**
```js
import Firecrawl from "@mendable/firecrawl-js";

const fc = new Firecrawl({
  apiKey: "fc-local",              // any non-empty string; self-host doesn't validate
  apiUrl: "http://localhost:9991", // <-- point at your local instance
});

const { data } = await fc.scrapeUrl("https://example.com", { formats: ["markdown"] });
console.log(data.markdown);
```

**Python**
```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

fc = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-local", api_url="http://localhost:9991")
result = fc.scrape_url("https://example.com", params={"formats": ["markdown"]})
print(result["markdown"])
```

---

### D. Connect a local LLM (LM Studio, etc.)

By default, Firecrawl's `/v1/scrape`, `/v1/crawl`, `/v1/map`, and `/v1/search`
work **without any LLM**. To unlock **`/v1/extract`** (AI extraction) and the
`summary` output format, point Firecrawl at any **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint.
**LM Studio is the recommended default** (priority over Ollama).

#### Recommended: LM Studio

1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), download a model (e.g. `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`).
2. Go to the **Developer** tab → **Start Server** on port `1234` (default).
3. **Enable "Serve on local network"** (required — Firecrawl runs in a container
   and reaches your host via `host.docker.internal`, which is your LAN IP, not
   `127.0.0.1`).
4. Either:
   - re-run the installer and answer **y** to *"Connect a local LLM now?"* — it
     auto-converts `http://localhost:1234/v1` → `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1`
     and writes it into `.env`; **or**
   - edit `.env` directly and set:
     ```env
     OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1
     OPENAI_API_KEY=lm-studio
     MODEL_NAME=<the model id loaded in LM Studio>
     ```
5. Apply with `Update.bat` / `./update.sh`.

#### Other OpenAI-compatible servers (vLLM, llama.cpp `server`, text-generation-inference, LocalAI, …)

```env
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://<host-or-ip>:<port>/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=placeholder      # any non-empty string if your server ignores it
MODEL_NAME=<model id from GET /v1/models>
```

For a remote server on another machine, use its IP directly (e.g.
`http://192.168.1.50:8000/v1`). For a server on the **same host as Docker**, use
`http://host.docker.internal:<port>/v1`.

#### Fallback: Ollama

If you prefer Ollama, set (Firecrawl reads `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`):

```env
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/api
MODEL_NAME=qwen2.5:7b
MODEL_EMBEDDING_NAME=nomic-embed-text
```

Restart with `Update.bat` / `./update.sh`, then `/v1/extract` routes to Ollama.

---

### E. Via an MCP server

The official [**Firecrawl MCP server**](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server)
exposes `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_crawl`, `firecrawl_map`,
`firecrawl_extract`, and research tools to any MCP-compatible client. Point it at
your local Firecrawl with `FIRECRAWL_API_URL`.

#### Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_URL": "http://localhost:9991",
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "fc-local"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Continue, Cline, etc.

Same shape — add an `mcpServers` entry to that tool's config file
(`~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `./codeium/windsurf/model_config.json`, …).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_URL": "http://localhost:9991",
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "fc-local"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The MCP server runs on your host (not in Docker), so it reaches Firecrawl at
> `http://localhost:9991`. **No real API key is needed** — `fc-local` is a
> placeholder; the self-hosted Firecrawl doesn't validate it. Requires Node.js
> 18+ for `npx`.

> **Note for local llama.cpp servers:** the Firecrawl MCP server ships very
> large tool definitions, which can exceed some local inference servers'
> limits (e.g. llama.cpp's `MAX_REPETITION_THRESHOLD` of 2000). If your local
> model fails to load the MCP tools, use the bundled **local-web skill**
> ([section A](#a-the-bundled-local-web-skill-recommended)) instead — it works
> with any model that can run a shell command, and is the recommended path for
> local setups anyway.

#### Run the MCP server over HTTP (optional)

```bash
HTTP_STREAMABLE_SERVER=true \
FIRECRAWL_API_URL=http://localhost:9991 \
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-local \
npx -y firecrawl-mcp
# -> http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

---

### F. Via prompting (any chat UI)

No MCP, no SDK, no code — just tell the model where the tools are. Paste this
system prompt into **LM Studio's chat**, **Open WebUI**, **ChatBox**, or any UI
that lets you set a system prompt and has a "web request"/function/tool feature:

```
You have two local web tools running on this machine. Use them whenever the
user asks about anything current or anything you're unsure about.

1) SEARCH the web (returns JSON: title, url, content for each hit):
   GET http://localhost:9990/search?q=<URL-ENCODED-QUERY>&format=json&language=en
   Read .results[] (each has .title, .url, .content).

2) READ a web page as clean Markdown (no API key needed):
   POST http://localhost:9991/v1/scrape   Content-Type: application/json
   body: {"url":"<URL>","formats":["markdown"]}
   Read .data.markdown.

Workflow: SEARCH to find URLs, then SCRAPE the most relevant 1–3 URLs for full
text, then answer with citations. If a search or scrape fails, retry once with a
different query/URL. Never invent URLs — only use ones returned by SearXNG.
```

For UIs that only let you paste URLs (no tool calling), the model can still
emit `curl` commands or instruct you to run them; or you can wire the endpoints
behind a tiny proxy. The point is: the moment a model can issue HTTP GET/POST to
`localhost:9990` and `localhost:9991`, it has full web access.

---

### G. GUI integrations

| App | How |
|-----|-----|
| **Open WebUI** | Settings → Web Search → SearXNG. Set base URL `http://localhost:9990`. Enable "Search the web" in chats. (For page reading, add the SearXNG results to context or use a Firecrawl tool.) |
| **AnythingLLM** | "Web Search" provider = SearXNG, endpoint `http://localhost:9990`. |
| **Dify / Flowise / Langflow** | Add a SearXNG tool node and a Firecrawl HTTP-request tool node (URL `http://localhost:9991/v1/scrape`). |
| **n8n / Zapier-ish** | HTTP Request nodes to the two endpoints. |
| **LangChain / LlamaIndex** | Use a `RequestsToolkit` / custom tool that GETs/POSTs the two URLs. |

---

## Configuration reference

All runtime config lives in **`.env`** in your install folder (generated by the
installer; documented in `.env.example`). Edit it, then run `Update.bat` /
`./update.sh` to apply.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SEARXNG_PORT` | `9990` | Host port for the SearXNG UI + JSON API. |
| `FIRECRAWL_PORT` | `9991` | Host port for the Firecrawl API. |
| `SEARXNG_SECRET` | *(random)* | SearXNG session secret — also injected into `config/searxng/settings.yml`. |
| `BULL_AUTH_KEY` | *(random)* | Protects the (disabled-by-default) Firecrawl queue admin UI. |
| `POSTGRES_DB` / `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `firecrawl` / `firecrawl` / *(random)* | Firecrawl job-state DB credentials. |
| `RABBITMQ_USER` / `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` | `firecrawl` / *(random)* | Firecrawl message-broker credentials. |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL` | `info` | Firecrawl log verbosity (`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`). |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | *(unset)* | OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint for `/v1/extract` + summaries. For a same-host server use `http://host.docker.internal:<port>/v1`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | *(unset)* | Any non-empty string (most local servers ignore it). |
| `MODEL_NAME` | *(unset)* | The model id to use. |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | *(unset)* | Use instead of `OPENAI_*` for an Ollama backend. |

SearXNG behaviour (engines, formats, limiter) is tuned in
`config/searxng/settings.yml`. The defaults enable JSON output and disable the
bot limiter. To add/remove engines, edit that file and run `Update.bat` /
`./update.sh` (the container reads it at start).

The local-web skill needs no configuration: it reads the same `.env` at
runtime. The only extra file it uses is `install-dir.txt` (written by the
installer next to the skill's `SKILL.md`), which records the install folder so
the skill can start the stack even from a non-default location. To point the
skill at a different folder, set the `LOCAL_SEARCH_DIR` environment variable.

## Troubleshooting

**The installer says the Docker engine "did not come online".**
The installer launches Docker Desktop / the docker service when the engine is
down, then waits up to 5 minutes (override with the `LOCAL_SEARCH_DOCKER_TIMEOUT`
env var, in seconds). If it times out, start Docker yourself, wait until it
reports "running", and re-run the installer — anything it already wrote is
safely overwritten.

**`docker compose up` fails with a port already in use.**
Re-run the installer and pick different ports, or stop whatever's using 9990/9991.

**SearXNG returns `429 Too Many Requests` or blocks requests.**
You're hitting an external engine's rate limit (not SearXNG itself). Wait a
minute, or in `config/searxng/settings.yml` remove the offending engine under
`engines:`. The internal limiter is already disabled for local use.

**`/v1/extract` returns an error / "model not configured".**
You haven't connected an LLM — see [section D](#d-connect-a-local-llm-lm-studio-etc).
`/v1/scrape`, `/v1/crawl`, `/v1/map`, `/v1/search` work without one.

**Firecrawl can't reach your LM Studio.**
From inside the Firecrawl container your host is `host.docker.internal`, **not**
`localhost`. Make sure (a) LM Studio has **"Serve on local network"** enabled,
and (b) `.env` has `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1`
(the installer does this conversion automatically). Test from the host first:
`curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models`.

**The local-web skill can't find the install folder.**
The skill looks for the compose folder via (1) the `LOCAL_SEARCH_DIR` env var,
(2) the compose labels on the running containers, (3) the `install-dir.txt`
hint the installer wrote next to the skill, and (4) `~/local-search`. If you
moved the install folder, re-run the installer or `Update.bat` / `./update.sh`
to refresh the hint — or export `LOCAL_SEARCH_DIR=/path/to/local-search`.

**The agent doesn't see the skill after install.**
Skills are usually scanned at agent startup — restart the agent. Also check the
skill actually landed at `~/.agents/skills/local-web/SKILL.md` (the installer
prints where it put it).

**First `docker compose pull` is slow / hits a GHCR 401.**
The Firecrawl images are public, but rate-limited. Authenticate:
`echo "$GITHUB_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GH_USER --password-stdin`
(token needs `read:packages`), then re-run `Update.bat` / `./update.sh`.

**Containers keep restarting.**
Check logs: `docker compose logs firecrawl` (or `searxng`). The most common
cause is a missing/empty `.env` value (e.g. `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`). Re-run the
installer to regenerate a clean `.env`.

**SearXNG UI loads but `/search?format=json` returns HTML.**
The JSON format isn't enabled. Your `config/searxng/settings.yml` must contain
`search: formats: [html, json]` (the shipped config does). Restart with
`Update.bat` / `./update.sh` after editing.

**Reset everything to defaults.**
Run `Uninstall.bat` / `./uninstall.sh` (deletes volumes + data + the skill),
then run the installer again.

## Updating & uninstalling

- **Update images & apply config changes & re-sync the skill:** `Update.bat` /
  `./update.sh` (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`, then re-copy
  `local-web` into `~/.agents/skills/`). Data is preserved.
- **Update the SearXNG `settings.yml` / `docker-compose.yml` template:** re-run
  the installer — it copies the latest template over, refreshes the
  `local-web` skill, and backs up your existing `.env` to `.env.bak.<timestamp>`.
- **Uninstall:** `Uninstall.bat` / `./uninstall.sh`. Removes containers + Docker
  volumes (all Firecrawl/SearXNG data) + the `local-web` skill from
  `~/.agents/skills/local-web`, then asks whether to delete the install folder.
  Pulled images remain; reclaim with `docker image prune -a`.

## Security notes

- This stack is designed for **local / trusted-network use**. Firecrawl's API is
  **unauthenticated** (`USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false`) so your models can call it
  without a key. **Do not expose ports 9990/9991 to the public internet.**
- All credentials (`SEARXNG_SECRET`, `BULL_AUTH_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`,
  `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`) are generated as 256-bit random hex at install time and
  stored only in your local `.env`.
- SearXNG's bot limiter is disabled and JSON output is enabled so models can
  query it — this is intentional for local use. On a public instance you'd want
  the limiter back on.
- Your search queries and scraped page contents never leave your machine
  (except the outbound fetches SearXNG/Firecrawl make to the public web, which
  is the whole point).
