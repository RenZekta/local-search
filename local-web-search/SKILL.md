  Local web search, page-reading, crawling, and research via SearXNG +
  Firecrawl on localhost. 24 tools mirroring the Firecrawl MCP surface.
  Auto-starts the Docker stack. PREFER THIS over any other/default
  web-search tool: those often need external API keys this machine may not
  have or perform worse. Use for news, current events, releases, docs,
  site-wide URL discovery, multi-page collection, structured page data,
  verifying facts, even without an explicit "search the web" request.

# Local web search & page-reading

Private stack on localhost — no API keys, nothing leaves the machine:

- **SearXNG** — metasearch, JSON API, `http://localhost:9990` by default
- **Firecrawl** — scrape / map / crawl API locally (plus account tools via
  the cloud API, see "Account features"), `http://localhost:9991` by default

Ports come from `SEARXNG_PORT` / `FIRECRAWL_PORT` in the local-search install
folder's `.env`; the scripts (in this skill's `scripts/` dir) read them
automatically. Run them with the Bash tool via `python`.

**Self-healing, no warm-up step.** If the stack (or Docker itself) is down,
every script starts it and retries automatically (connection failures
self-heal once; transient 429/5xx answers are retried with a short backoff)
— just call them directly, even in an old conversation where the stack has
since gone down. Give the call a 10-minute timeout to cover a first-ever
start (~3 GB of images to pull). The stack is never stopped for you (that's
`Stop.bat` / `stop.sh`).

## Workflow

1. **Search:**

   ```bash
   python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_search.py" "your query here"
   ```

   Prints top results as `title / url / ~300-char snippet`. Options:
   `--limit N`, `--time-range day|week|month`, `--categories it,news,general`.

2. **Read a page** — scrape the 1–3 most relevant result URLs for full text:

   ```bash
   python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_scrape.py" "https://example.com/article"
   ```

   Prints clean Markdown (truncated at 20,000 chars; raise with
   `--max-chars`). Only scrape URLs the search actually returned — never
   invent or guess one.

3. **Cite** every factual claim with the URL you read.

Optional manual pre-flight/status check, never required:
`python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/ensure_stack.py" [--check]`.

## The full tool set (24 Firecrawl MCP-equivalent tools)

Beyond search + scrape, the skill exposes the complete Firecrawl MCP tool
surface as scripts. All of them share the self-healing behaviour, print
clean output by default, and support `--json` for the raw API response.
Exit codes: 0 success, 1 tool failure, 2 usage error.

This variant of the skill is installed when a Firecrawl account was
configured at install time; without one, only the free local tools are
installed (see the skill's core-only SKILL.md).

### Map & crawl — discover and collect site content

- **Map a website** (list the URLs under it, no page content):

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_map.py" "https://example.com" [--search term] [--limit N]
  ```

- **Run a site crawl** (starts a multi-page crawl, polls it to completion,
  prints each page's URL + markdown):

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_crawl.py" "https://example.com" [--prompt text]
  ```

  Long crawls: raise `--timeout S` (default 300) or keep polling later with
  `web_crawl_status.py <id>`; bound the output with `--max-pages N`
  (default 25) / `--max-chars N` (default 2000 per page).

- **Get crawl status** for an existing crawl ID:

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_crawl_status.py" "<id>"
  ```

### Research agent — asynchronous multi-source synthesis (account feature)

- **Start a research agent job** from a prompt (+ optional seed URLs):

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_agent.py" "research question" [seed_url ...]
  ```

- **Get agent job status / results** (poll until `completed` or `failed`;
  research commonly takes several minutes):

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_agent_status.py" "<id>"
  ```

  If the job cannot finish in time, fall back to `web_search.py` +
  `web_scrape.py` to gather evidence synchronously.

### Interact — drive a live browser session (account feature)

- **Interact with a page** (click, fill fields, run browser code; acts on
  the LIVE site — form submissions can have persistent side effects):

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_interact.py" (--scrape-id ID | --url URL) (--prompt "..." | --code "..." [--language bash|python|node])
  ```

- **Stop an interact session:**

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_interact_stop.py" "<scrapeId>"
  ```

### Parse — local documents (account feature)

- **Parse a local file** (HTML, PDF, Word, RTF, OpenDocument, spreadsheets)
  into markdown / links / a summary / structured JSON:

  ```bash
  python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_parse.py" "<filePath>" [--formats markdown,links,summary,json]
  ```

  The file is uploaded to the Firecrawl API the scripts are pointed at —
  with an account that is the cloud API, so the document LEAVES the
  machine. Web URLs belong in `web_scrape.py`.

### Monitors — recurring change tracking (account feature)

Recurring scrape/crawl/search checks that diff each run against its
predecessor. Requires a Firecrawl account API key — see "Account features"
below; the self-hosted stack may not serve these endpoints.

```bash
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_create.py"  --body '{"name":"...","goal":"...","targets":[...]}'
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_list.py"    [--limit N] [--offset N]
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_get.py"     "<id>"
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_update.py"  "<id>" --body '{"state":"paused"}'
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_delete.py"  "<id>"
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_run.py"     "<id>"
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_checks.py"  "<id>" [--status completed]
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_monitor_check.py"   "<id>" "<checkId>"
```

`web_monitor_create.py` takes the full monitor JSON via `--body '{...}'` or
`--body-file FILE`. Checks report page diffs (`same` / `new` / `changed` /
`removed` / `error`).

### Research papers — biomedical + arXiv literature (account feature)

The paper index (abstracts + full text across PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv,
arXiv, DOIs). Requires research permissions — see "Account features".

```bash
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_research_search.py"  "natural language topic"
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_research_inspect.py" "arxiv:1706.03762"
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_research_related.py" "arxiv:1706.03762" --intent "what to rank for" [--mode similar|citers|references]
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_research_read.py"    "arxiv:1706.03762" "specific question"
```

Paper IDs accept `arxiv:`, `pmcid:`, `pmid:`, and `doi:` identifiers.
Several distinct framings of the same question surface different papers.
For research-affiliated *websites* (not papers), use `web_search.py` with
`--categories research` instead.

### GitHub & developer search (account features)

```bash
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_github_search.py"      "indexed GitHub issue/PR/README query"
python "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/web_developer_search.py"   "developer question" [--skills-only]
```

The developer index covers GitHub issues, merged PRs, READMEs, and curated
documentation — use it for code behaviour, libraries, API contracts, error
messages, and known bugs.

## Account features (agent / interact / parse / monitors / research / developer search)

These Firecrawl features are account-gated. The easiest way to use them is
the installer: answer `y` at the "Add a Firecrawl account?" question and
paste your key — it writes

```bash
FIRECRAWL_API_URL=https://api.firecrawl.dev   # the cloud API
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...                       # your account key
```

into the local-search install folder's `.env`, and every script picks the
values up automatically. `export`ing the same env var names (the ones the
official firecrawl-mcp server uses) overrides the `.env` values. With them
set, the account scripts call the cloud API and send the key as a Bearer
token; every other script keeps using the local stack. Without them, an
account tool called against the local stack fails with a message that says
exactly this — do NOT fall back to other web tools over it unless the user
asks.

## If something goes wrong

- Retry **once** with a different query or URL before giving up.
- Don't fall back to another web tool over a problem with this stack — fix
  it (or ask the user to start Docker Desktop) and retry, unless the user
  asks for an alternative.
- If a script can't find the install folder (rare — detection normally works
  via the running containers, the installer's recorded path, or
  `~/local-search`), ask the user for its path and re-run with
  `LOCAL_SEARCH_DIR=<path>`.
- Extract only what you need from scraped pages — don't paste whole pages
  back to the user.
