"""Read a web page as clean Markdown via the local Firecrawl instance.

Usage:
    python web_scrape.py <url> [--max-chars 20000]

Self-healing: if the local-search stack is unreachable (Docker engine or the
containers are down), this script automatically starts them (the same logic
as ensure_stack.py / Run.bat) and retries the scrape once. You do NOT need
to run ensure_stack.py first — just run the scrape.

When a page fails to load, the script checks the network path to the site
(DNS + one short TCP connection, see config.diagnose_url) and says plainly
whether the route is blocked — e.g. a proxy/VPN fake-IP such as 198.18.x.x
whose traffic is dropped. A blocked route is NOT retried or waited on, and a
running stack is never restarted over a page that merely timed out.

Prints the page's Markdown to stdout, truncated at --max-chars.
